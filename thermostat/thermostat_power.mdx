## Parts You Will Need

For wall mounting:

- Screw Driver
- Drill & Drill Bit
- Level
- Pencil

### Prepare The Wall Mounting Location

- Before mounting the wall mount bracket, find a suitable location on the wall for the Thermostat.
<Tip>
Look for a location where the temperature is most representative of the ambient room temperature and has no hazards within the wall.
</Tip>
- Decide how you will mount the wall bracket to the wall:
 - Install A: Screws with wall anchors (recommended)
 - Install B: Adhesive (provided in-box. Adhesive should only be used
for painted drywall, glass, and metal.)
- Using a level, pencil a small horizontal line on the wall where you intend to place the Thermostat. We recommend mounting the Thermostat anywhere from 3 to 5 feet from the floor.
<Tip>
If installing near a light switch, center the Thermostat with the light switch, and place it about 1.5-2.5 inches away from the switch for a cohesive look.
</Tip>

Follow the instructions below on the following pages based on your chosen wall mounting:

### Install A: Screw-Mount to Wall with Pre-Installed In-Wall Wiring

- At the center of your horizontal pencil line, using a ½ in. drill bit, drill a hole into the hollow of the wall.
- If you are not installing directly into a stud, line up the wall mount to the horizontal line, and mark the screw locations using the provided wall mount. Use a ⅛ in. drill bit to drill pilot holes at the marked locations. Now push the drywall anchors into the holes.
- Using suitable in-wall wiring, fish the power wire from your intended power source location and through the ½ in. hole you drilled. Fasten the wires with tape to prevent them from falling back into the wall.
- Pull the wires through the large center hole in the Thermostat wall mount, so that the flat side of the wall mount is positioned against the wall.
- Use the horizontal line indicators on the wall mount to align it to your horizontal pencil line; mark the locations of the screw holes on your wall. Ensure that the Airform logo is right side up.
